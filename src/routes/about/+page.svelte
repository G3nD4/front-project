		<h1>Our Heritage</h1>
		<div class="info">
			<p>
				Our story begins in 1971 along the cobblestone streets of Seattle’s historic Pike Place
				Market. It was here where Starbucks opened its first store, offering fresh-roasted coffee
				beans, tea and spices from around the world for our customers to take home. Our name was
				inspired by the classic tale, “Moby-Dick,” evoking the seafaring tradition of the early
				coffee traders.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ten years later, a young New Yorker named Howard Schultz would walk through these doors and
				become captivated with Starbucks coffee from his first sip. After joining the company in
				1982, a different cobblestone road would lead him to another discovery. It was on a trip to
				Milan in 1983 that Howard first experienced Italy’s coffeehouses, and he returned to Seattle
				inspired to bring the warmth and artistry of its coffee culture to Starbucks. By 1987, we
				swapped our brown aprons for green ones and embarked on our next chapter as a coffeehouse.
			</p>
			<p>
				Starbucks would soon expand to Chicago and Vancouver, Canada and then on to California,
				Washington, D.C. and New York. By 1996, we would cross the Pacific to open our first store
				in Japan, followed by Europe in 1998 and China in 1999. Over the next two decades, we would
				grow to welcome millions of customers each week and become a part of the fabric of tens of
				thousands of neighborhoods all around the world. In everything we do, we are always
				dedicated to Our Mission: With every cup, with every conversation, with every community - we
				nurture the limitless possibilities of human connection.
